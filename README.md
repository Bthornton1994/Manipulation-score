# Manipulation Score — Clarity

**Clarity** is the message analysis product from **Manipulation Score**—a privacy-first tool that helps people identify potentially manipulative language, understand the signals behind a score, and choose grounded responses.

Clarity runs entirely in your browser. No accounts, no uploads, no analytics.

## Features

- On-device pattern analysis with highlighted evidence in the message
- Eight language signal categories with plain-language explanations
- Three response styles: pause, boundary, and clarify
- Installable PWA with offline support after first visit
- Self-hosted fonts — no third-party requests at runtime
- Legal pages: privacy, terms, and limitations

## Run locally

No build step or package install required.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Open http://localhost:4173.

## Test

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.js
```

## Deploy

GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`. Enable Pages under repository Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.

**Production URLs:** https://manipulationscore.com and https://www.manipulationscore.com

The `CNAME` file sets the apex domain as canonical. GitHub Pages serves both hostnames and redirects `www` to the apex domain once DNS is configured.

Configure DNS at your registrar:

### Apex domain (`manipulationscore.com`)

Add **A** records for `@`:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A | @ | `185.199.108.153` |
| A | @ | `185.199.109.153` |
| A | @ | `185.199.110.153` |
| A | @ | `185.199.111.153` |

Optional **AAAA** records for IPv6:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| AAAA | @ | `2606:50c0:8000::153` |
| AAAA | @ | `2606:50c0:8001::153` |
| AAAA | @ | `2606:50c0:8002::153` |
| AAAA | @ | `2606:50c0:8003::153` |

### `www` subdomain (`www.manipulationscore.com`)

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | www | `bthornton1994.github.io` |

### GitHub Pages settings

1. Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**
2. Settings → Pages → Custom domain: `manipulationscore.com`
3. After DNS checks pass for both hostnames, enable **Enforce HTTPS**

GitHub provisions TLS for both `manipulationscore.com` and `www.manipulationscore.com`. Visitors on `www` are redirected to the apex domain (canonical URL for SEO and sharing).
